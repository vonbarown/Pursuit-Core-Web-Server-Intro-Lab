## Problem One - Random User Generator Server Clone

### Make the server

Build a simple version of the [random user API](https://randomuser.me/api/?inc=gender,name,nat&&results=10)

When you hit the server, it should return the following JSON

<details>
  <summary>JSON</summary>

```js
{
  "results": [
    {
      "gender": "female",
      "name": {
        "title": "mademoiselle",
        "first": "ruth",
        "last": "nicolas"
      },
      "nat": "CH"
    },
    {
      "gender": "female",
      "name": {
        "title": "miss",
        "first": "رها",
        "last": "سلطانی نژاد"
      },
      "nat": "IR"
    },
    {
      "gender": "female",
      "name": {
        "title": "mrs",
        "first": "patricia",
        "last": "hale"
      },
      "nat": "GB"
    },
    {
      "gender": "male",
      "name": {
        "title": "mr",
        "first": "fernando",
        "last": "cooper"
      },
      "nat": "US"
    },
    {
      "gender": "female",
      "name": {
        "title": "mrs",
        "first": "یسنا",
        "last": "صدر"
      },
      "nat": "IR"
    },
    {
      "gender": "male",
      "name": {
        "title": "mr",
        "first": "eino",
        "last": "tuomala"
      },
      "nat": "FI"
    },
    {
      "gender": "female",
      "name": {
        "title": "ms",
        "first": "gonca",
        "last": "özkara"
      },
      "nat": "TR"
    },
    {
      "gender": "male",
      "name": {
        "title": "mr",
        "first": "kyle",
        "last": "castillo"
      },
      "nat": "US"
    },
    {
      "gender": "female",
      "name": {
        "title": "miss",
        "first": "olivia",
        "last": "kumar"
      },
      "nat": "NZ"
    },
    {
      "gender": "male",
      "name": {
        "title": "monsieur",
        "first": "raymond",
        "last": "durand"
      },
      "nat": "CH"
    }
  ],
  "info": {
    "seed": "2cb086ce097c87ee",
    "results": 10,
    "page": 1,
    "version": "1.2"
  }
}
```

</details>

### Build the UI

Then build a front end that displays all of the users as cards, using a default profile image of your choosing.  It should look somewhat like [this](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp)

## Problem Two - Opentdb clone

### Make the server

Build a simple version of the [open trivia database](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=18&type=multiple
).  

When you hit the server, it should return the following json:

<details>
  <summary>JSON</summary>

```js

  "response_code": 0,
  "results": [

      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</details>

### Build the UI

Put together a front end that shows one question at a time.  Your display should have:

- A `p` tag for the question
- A `select` tag for all possible answers
- A `button` to submit their answer

When the user submits their answer, the UI should indicate if they were right or wrong, then present the next question.

## Bonus

- Have your server have more people/trivia questions available and randomly select which 10 to give you each time you call it.
